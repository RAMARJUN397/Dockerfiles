Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tool or system that is used to automate tasks such as the
management, monitoring, scaling, and deployment of containerized applications.

It is used to easily manage several containers (since it can handle grouping of containers), 
which provides for logical units that can be discovered and managed.


kubeadm: the command to bootstrap the cluster.
kubelet: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting PODs and containers. 
kubectl: the command line until to talk to your cluster.
