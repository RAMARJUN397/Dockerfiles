Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tool or system that is used to automate tasks such as the
management, monitoring, scaling, and deployment of containerized applications.

It is used to easily manage several containers (since it can handle grouping of containers), 
which provides for logical units that can be discovered and managed.

Why K8s:-
1.Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently
2.It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more
Benefits of Kubernetes
Scalability: Kubernetes scales applications horizontally by adding or removing pod replicas based on demand.
High Availability: It provides built-in mechanisms to ensure that your applications are highly available by
distributing them across multiple nodes.
Self-Healing: Kubernetes automatically restarts failed containers and replaces unhealthy pods,
ensuring the desired state is maintained.
Rolling Updates and Rollbacks: Deployments enable seamless rolling updates of application
versions and facilitate easy rollbacks in case of issues.
Service Discovery and Load Balancing: Kubernetes services allow applications 
to discover and communicate with each other, distributing traffic evenly across pods


kubeadm: the command to bootstrap the cluster.
kubelet: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting PODs and containers. 
kubectl: the command line until to talk to your cluster.
